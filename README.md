# Excel UI

Excel UI is a react clone of excel sheets.

## Installation

Use yarn to install the dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

Use yarn to start the app.

```bash
yarn start
```

## Approach

-   The app has been setup from scratch using a basic webpack setup.
-   The directory has been split-up into sections like `public`, `src` and `components` to organise the code.
-   The components have been broken down semantically and stored in the `components` directory.
-   `App` component aggregates all the required components from the `components` directory and builds the final UI.
